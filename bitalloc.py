def BitAlloc(bitBudget, maxMantBits, nBands, nLines, SMR):
    """
    Allocates bits to scale factor bands so as to flatten the NMR across the spectrum

       Arguments:
           bitBudget is total number of mantissa bits to allocate
           maxMantBits is max mantissa bits that can be allocated per line
           nBands is total number of scale factor bands
           nLines[nBands] is number of lines in each scale factor band
           SMR[nBands] is signal-to-mask ratio in each scale factor band

        Return:
            bits[nBands] is number of bits allocated to each scale factor band

        Logic:
           Maximizing SMR over block gives optimization result that:
               R(i) = P/N + (1 bit/ 6 dB) * (SMR[i] - avgSMR)
           where P is the pool of bits for mantissas and N is number of bands
           This result needs to be adjusted if any R(i) goes below 2 (in which
           case we set R(i)=0) or if any R(i) goes above maxMantBits (in
           which case we set R(i)=maxMantBits).  (Note: 1 Mantissa bit is
           equivalent to 0 mantissa bits when you are using a midtread quantizer.)
           We will not bother to worry about slight variations in bit budget due
           rounding of the above equation to integer values of R(i).
